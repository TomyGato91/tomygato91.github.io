## This Python program gives the day of the week you were born by giving your birth date

**Project description:** This is a starting program that I wrote while practicing my knowledge in Python and the use of different libraries. In this case the project is based on the libraries datetime & calendar. Both are useful in order to manipulate time modules and work directly in days, months and years in order to get different information. 

### 1. Import both libraries 



```javascript
import datetime as dt
import calendar as cal
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
